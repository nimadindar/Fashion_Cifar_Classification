Fashion mnist and Cifar10 classification using convolutional Networks

Bulding and convolutional network model and using Fahion mnist and Cifar10 objects for classification. 
Model gets tuned hyper-parameters to build the best model and plots loss/accuracy per epoch.

The file dataloder.py loades either fashion_mnist or cifar10 and fcNetwork.py builds tuner and model.
Run main.py to tune , train and plot the model.
